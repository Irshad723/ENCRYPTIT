                <h3>1. Caesar Cipher</h3>
                <p>The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> With a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.</p>

                <h3>2. Vigenère Cipher</h3>
                <p>The Vigenère Cipher is a more complex form of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted according to the corresponding letter in a key.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the key is "KEY", then 'A' is shifted by 'K' (10 positions), 'B' by 'E' (4 positions), etc.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>3. XOR Cipher</h3>
                <p>The XOR cipher is a symmetric key encryption technique where each bit of the plaintext is XORed with a corresponding bit of the key. The XOR operation is reversible, meaning it can be used for both encryption and decryption.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> XORing the binary of 'A' with the binary of a key (e.g., 01100101) produces a ciphertext that can be reversed with the same key.</p>

                <h3>4. Atbash Cipher</h3>
                <p>The Atbash Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the alphabet is mapped to its reverse counterpart.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y', and so on.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Rot13 Cipher</h3>
                <p>The Rot13 Cipher is a special case of the Caesar Cipher where the shift is always 13. It is commonly used to obscure text without requiring a key.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', and so on.</p>
